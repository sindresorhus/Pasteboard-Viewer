This is a developer utility that lets you inspect the various system pasteboards. This can be useful to ensure your app is putting the correct data on [NSPasteboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard) or [UIPasteboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipasteboard/). The app refreshes the pasteboard contents live and can preview text, RTF, images, and anything that has a Quick Look preview.

Note that this is not a clipboard manager. If you're not a programmer, you probably don't want this app.

On macOS, you can make the window always stay in front by enabling “Stay in Front” in the “Window” menu.

Use the up/down arrow keys to switch between the pasteboard items.

It hides obsolete system pasteboard types that have modern equivalents. This includes `CorePasteboardFlavorType`, `NSStringPboardType`, `NSFilenamesPboardType`, etc.

Tip: Right-click (macOS) or long-tap (non-macOS) an item in the sidebar to copy the type identifier.

## FAQ

#### What's with the genie lamp?

It's a reference to the icon of Apple's old NSPasteboard sample app called [Clipboard Viewer](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/ClipboardViewer/Introduction/Intro.html).
